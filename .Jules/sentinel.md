## 2026-01-26 - Command Injection via S3270 Pipe
**Vulnerability:** The `SendKey` method in `internal/host/s3270.go` accepted raw strings which were sent directly to the `s3270` process pipe. If a key string contained a newline (`\n`), `s3270` would interpret the subsequent line as a new command, allowing injection of arbitrary s3270 commands (like `Quit`, `Script`, or potentially `Exec` if enabled).
**Learning:** Even when wrapping an external process, the communication channel (pipe) can be a vector for injection if the protocol (newline-delimited) is not respected by the wrapper. Defense in depth requires validation at the wrapper level (`S3270` struct) rather than relying solely on upstream callers (`cmd/3270Web`).
**Prevention:** Always validate inputs that are written to an external process's stdin to ensure they do not contain protocol delimiters (newlines, null bytes, etc.).
